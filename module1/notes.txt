val vs var

val some_name = "hello"  # this string type is inherited and cannot be changed
var some_count = 1    # infers int type, some_count CAN be changed, but Type CANNOT be changed


# how to name a function


fun some_name (some_parameters) : return_type {
    fun_body_code
}

Example:
fun birthdayGreeting(name: String): String {
    val nameGreeting = "Happy Birthday, Rover!"
    val ageGreeting = "You are now 5 years old"
    return "$nameGreeting \n $ageGreeting"
}
